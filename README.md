# PixelQuest Gaming Studios

## Summary of the scenario and proposed solution
Scenario:

- PixelQuest Gaming Studios, a mid-sized developer known for story-driven single-player games, is facing several modernisation challenges:

- Limited player engagement due to a lack of a centralised community or platform.

- Inefficient feedback collection, with data scattered across unconnected channels.

- Outdated internal tools affecting developer collaboration and productivity.

- Missed monetisation opportunities, as all purchases happen through third-party platforms.

Proposed Solution:

To address these issues, this project proposes the development of the PixelQuest Hub â€” a desktop launcher, alongside additional monetisable features in our single player games. This will consist of:

- Central hub page
- Ability to launch games
- Forum pages
- Storefront
- Bug Report / Reviews
- Additional monetisable features to our games


## Part 1: Potential Solutions

Web store to sell the games on (website)

Launcher (app) to be on our customers PC:
- Download and launch the games 
- Player feedback
- Player forums
- Bug reports (just small on the side)

Add more social features to our single player experiences

## Part 3: Agile Mini-Project
### Project Vision Statement
We are going to build a game launcher and store front to consolidate our platform and offer social features to our community. 

### User Stories
**Players** = As a player I want to connect with more of the gaming community so that I can meet new people. 

**CEO** = As a CEO I want to develop additional monetisation strategies within our games so that we can increase our revenue. 

**Developer** = As a developer I want to create a product that challenges me and forces me to learn new skills so that I can advance my career. 

**Player** = As a player I do not want to be taken advantage of by aggressive monetisation practises that are not consumer friendly so that I can enjoy the game and still feel valued. 

**SCRUM master** = As a SCRUM master I want clear and feasible requirements that I can communicate to my development team effectively so that the project runs smoothly and everyone is happy. 

**Product owner** = As a product owner I want to produce a successful product that incentivises new users to join the platform and monetises our existing user base more effectively so that I can maximise company revenue.
